For example, someone might be shown a series of words and asked if each word is \"old\" (that is, one that they have seen before) or \"new\" (that is, a word that they didn't see during the study). Words that were actually shown before are called \"targets\" and words that were not shown before are called \"lures\".

    "[Signal detection theory](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/sdt/sdt.html) is a general framework for simulating detection of a some sort of signal. For example, when deciding if a word has been previously seen before, people may use some sort of memory strength signal, which tends to be stronger for previously seen words. In this model, people will say \"old\" to indicate that a word has been seen before if the strength exceeds some threshold or *criterion*, and otherwise they will say \"new\" indicate that the word has not been seen before.\n",

    "Use NumPy to simulate 500 target trials and 500 lure trials, using `np.random.default_rng` with a seed of 42. The target memory strengths should be sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.5. The lure memory strength distribution should have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5. Test two criterion values; criterion 1 will be 0.5, and criterion 2 will be 0.8. Increasing the criterion will reduce false alarms, but will also lower the hit rate.\n",

    "Randomly generate memory strength for 500 targets and 500 lures, and compare them to the criterion to determine what the behavioral response will be. In the simulation, any trial with strength greater than or equal to the criterion will generate the response \"old\", and any trial with strength less than the criterion will generate the response \"new\". Calculate hit rate and false alarm rate in your simulation, for each of the two criterion values.\n",
