    "[Signal detection theory](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/sdt/sdt.html) is a general framework for simulating detection of a some sort of signal. For example, when deciding if a word has been previously seen before, people may use some sort of memory strength signal, which tends to be stronger for previously seen words. In this model, people will say \"old\" to indicate that a word has been seen before if the strength exceeds some threshold or *criterion*, and otherwise they will say \"new\" indicate that the word has not been seen before.\n",

The target memory strengths should be sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.5. The lure memory strength distribution should have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5. Test two criterion values; criterion 1 will be 0.5, and criterion 2 will be 0.8. Increasing the criterion will reduce false alarms, but will also lower the hit rate.\n",

Calculate hit rate and false alarm rate in your simulation, for each of the two criterion values.\n",
