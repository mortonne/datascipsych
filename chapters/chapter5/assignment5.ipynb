If any given random number is less than the `prob` for that trial, then in our simulation, the behavior (in this example, freezing in response to a feared stimulus) will be emitted. For example, if the `prob` on a trial is 0.1, then a randomly generated variable from 0 to 1 will be less than `prob` 10% of the time.

For example, if there were 5 trials in one bin where the behavior occurred, then the response probability for that bin will be $5 / 25 = 0.2$. Create a plot of your learning curve using `plt.plot`."
