    "Read about [advanced indexing](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/user/basics.indexing.html#advanced-indexing) in NumPy. When using advanced indexing with multiple dimensions, you can pass one array of integers for each dimension of the array. Given the 2D array `m`, defined below, get the *diagonal* of the matrix by indexing it using two arrays of integers. The diagonal is defined as the elements of a matrix where the row and column are the same. For a 3x3 matrix $m$, the diagonal includes $m_{1,1}$, $m_{2,2}$, and $m_{3,3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonal of a matrix can also be extracted using `np.diag`. Get the diagonal of `m` using that method also."
